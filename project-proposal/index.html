		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<p>
            The goal of this project is to create a game where players are able 
            to interact with their environment (pick up/run into objects), and each 
            interaction would change the scene to a different shading style using 
            stylized shaders. We will be combining different shaders to create a unique 
            world depending on what the player selects.
        </p>

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>
            In most games, the visual style remains consistent throughout, limiting how 
            graphics can reflect changing gameplay or player interaction. Our project 
            explores the challenge of dynamically switching between distinct shading 
            styles — such as cel shading, photorealism, and retro graphics — in a single 
            interactive scene. This involves combining different shaders in a cohesive 
            way, managing performance, and creating smooth, visually engaging transitions. 
            By allowing players to trigger these shader changes through environmental 
            interactions, we aim to create a playful, immersive experience that pushes 
            the boundaries of traditional game aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
            To tackle this, we will build a Unity-based 1st person game that 
            incorporates 3 different possible base shaders. Instead of writing 
            shaders from scratch, we will modify and customize existing ones to 
            suit our visual and interactive goals. The player will be able to 
            interact with items or environments — like bumping into a "water" 
            object to switch to a fluid simulation style, or picking up a pixelated 
            item to enter a retro shader space. Furthermore, when the player 
            interacts with multiple items together, we switch to a shader that 
            visually looks like a combination of the base shaders. As a stretch goal, 
            we plan to explore the implementation in VR to further enhance the 
            immersion, using hand interactions to trigger these visual transformations.
        </p>
		
		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		<ol>
            <li>What we plan to deliver:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Baseline Goal: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Create a scene in Unity with 3 different possible 
                                base shaders. We will modify existing shaders rather than using 
                                them from scratch.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We will also write custom shaders that are 
                                combinations of the base shaders (3 combos that are pairs, 1 combo 
                                consisting of all 3 base shaders).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Our current idea is to hard-code 
                                each of these combination shaders in High-Level Shader Language 
                                (HLSL) based on an understanding of the mechanics of their underlying 
                                shaders.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What we hope to deliver:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stretch Goals:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Create an interactive VR game in Unity where players are 
                                capable of changing the world's shading style by 
                                interacting with different objects (representing 
                                different shaders) in the environment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allow single objects in the VR world to be shaded 
                                differently from the rest of the world.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create a generalized algorithm for combining shaders - 
                                create a toggle (or multiple toggles) that changes the 
                                influence of each shader on the final result (i.e. 
                                70% shader 1, 30% shader 2).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Performance metrics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Smooth and quick transition when shading style changes</li>
                    <li>Intuitive interactions between the player and shader objects</li>
                    <li>The combined shaders should be visually convincing and appealing</li>
                    <li>Have objects of different textures in the scene and be able to render them with different shaders appropriately</li>
                    <li>FPS >= 24</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                What questions do you plan to answer?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How can we efficiently manage and switch between multiple 
                        shaders on shared scene geometry or objects without causing 
                        noticeable rendering artifacts or performance issues in Unity?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can we blend or layer multiple shader effects on a single 
                        object or scene in Unity without breaking visual consistency?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What are effective ways to design interactions that trigger 
                        shader transitions in a way that feels intuitive and 
                        immersive for the player?
                    </li>

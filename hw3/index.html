      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, we first implemented methods to generate rays via
        sampling, trace rays through the scene, and calculate intersections of
        the rays with different objects/primitives in the scene. To effectively
        trace ray intersections, we built a BVH tree to keep track of all of the
        primitives in the scene, improving our traversal efficiency. We then
        implemented various functions to calculate direct and global
        illumination in scenes with objects that have a diffuse BSDF. In direct
        and global illumination implementations, we tried to improve the
        rendering quality and efficiency using heuristics like importance
        sampling, Russian Roulette, and adaptive sampling.
      </p>
      <p>What we’ve learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Completing this assignment really helped us solidify our understanding
          of path tracing. One thing we understood more, as we broke down our
          code, was the recursive nature of calculating global illumination.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was very rewarding to see the dramatic speed-ups achieved by using
          a bounding volume hierarchy, as well as the noise reduction and slight
          speed-ups achieved by using importance sampling, Russian Roulette, and
          adaptive sampling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
      <b>Camera Ray Generation</b>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, we translate and scale x and y to camera-space dimensions. We
          translate x and y by -0.5 to realign to a (0, 0, 0) origin. Then, we
          scale x and y to camera-space dimensions by scaling by a factor of >2
          * (tan(convertToRadians(hFov / 2)))and 2 * (tan(convertToRadians(vFov
          / 2))), respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          We apply the camera-to-world rotation matrix to the ray direction
          vector we just found (xCamSpace, yCamSpace, -1). We also normalize the
          ray direction vector.
        </li>
        <li>
          We apply the camera-to-world rotation matrix to the origin, as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          We initialize the final ray Ray(originWorldSpace, dirWorldSpace), set
          ray.min_t = nClip, ray.max_t = fClip, and return the ray.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <b>Primitive Intersection</b>
      <p>
        Each primitive class have has_intersection and intersection and
        functions. Given a ray, we determine the time(s) t that the ray
        intersects with the primitive by plugging in the ray into the
        primitive’s equation and solving for t. We take the soonest valid t (>0,
        and between ray.min_t and ray.max_t), and determine the point of
        intersection p = r.o + t * r.d.
      </p>

      <b>Ray Intersection Algorithm</b>

      <p>
        To test for ray-triangle intersection, we first test for ray-plane
        intersection.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          We find the vector normal to the triangle’s plane N = cross(p2 - p1,
          p3 - p1).
        </li>
        <li>
          If dot(r.d, N) == 0, the ray must be parallel to the plane, and so we
          return false.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, we find the time of intersection t = dot((p1 - r.o), N) /
          dot(r.d, N). This formula is derived from the plane equation dot(p -
          p’, N) = 0, and setting p = r(t) = r.o + r.d * t.
        </li>
        <li>
          If t is invalid (< 0) or outside of our bounds (< r.min_t or >
          r.max_t), we return false.
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, we determine the intersect point = r.o + t * r.d.</li>
      </ol>

      Now that we’ve determined the point of intersection of the ray with the
      plane, we see if the point is inside the triangle using the 3-line test.
      We rewrote our inside-triangle code from Homework 1 for testing in 3D
      space.

      <ol>
        <li>
          We first determine the winding order, and if it’s clockwise, we
          reassign the points so that they are in counterclockwise order.
        </li>
        <li>
          We perform the 3-line test. For each edge of the triangle, we find T =
          p2 - p1, the vector along the edge. We find V = p - p1, the vector
          from the 1st vertex of the edge to the point of intersection. We find
          L = dot(cross(T, V), N), where N is the vertex normal to the
          triangle’s plane (same as before). If L >= 0, the point is on the edge
          or inside the edge, and it passes the line test. The point is inside
          the triangle if it passes all three line tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the point is inside the triangle, we have a valid point of
          intersection between the ray and the triangle! We update r.max_t = t.
          In intersect, we also initialize isect.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>
        To construct the Bound Volume Hierarchy, we take all the primitives and
        stick them in a BVHNode while keeping track of the number of primitives
        in the node. If the node contains less than max_leaf_size number of
        primitives, this node is a leaf node and we can directly return the
        node. Otherwise, this node is an inner node and we need to split the
        node into left and right sub-nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        To determine how to split the node, we then first compare the extents of
        the x, y, and z axes using bb.extent and find the longest axis. We set
        our split value to (bb.min[axis] + bb.max[axis]) / 2, i.e. the midpoint
        between the min and max value along the longest axis among the given
        primitives. We also added a fallback method in case splitting by the
        midpoint leaves one of the sub-nodes empty. In the fallback method, we
        pick the split value by taking the average of the centroid of all
        primitives. This method offers another chance to regroup the primitives
        into two nodes. If the left or the right sub-node is still empty after
        this, we will just return the node as is to prevent infinite looping.
        Lastly, we make sure to recursively construct the tree by calling
        construct_bvh() for node->l and node->r.

        We compare rendering times with and without BVH acceleration for
        maxplanck.dae (which has 50801 primitives) and peter.dae (which has
        40018 primitives).
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        We see that using a BVH greatly speeds up rendering time. For
        maxplanck.dae, rendering without BVH acceleration took 764.6717 seconds,
        v.s. 0.1524 seconds with BVH acceleration. Similarly, for peter.dae,
        rendering without BVH acceleration took 614.2433 seconds, v.s. 0.2317
        seconds with BVH acceleration. We also see that with BVH, the average
        intersection tests per ray drops dramatically. For maxplanck.dae,
        without BVH we averaged 10610.584196 intersection tests per ray, v.s.
        2.817723 intersection tests per ray with BVH. For peter.dae, without BVH
        we averaged 7886.058256 intersection tests per ray, v.s. 2.968768
        intersection tests per ray with BVH. The BVH tree helps us eliminate
        unnecessary intersection tests in nodes that the ray won’t cross at all.
        Since we only do an intersection test with the small subset of the
        primitives in the leaf node we traverse down to, we drastically reduce
        the overall number of intersection tests needed. Since it is less costly
        to process each ray, we can now process more rays at a time. For
        maxplanck.dae, without BVH we averaged 0.0006 million rays per second,
        v.s. 2.5956 million rays per second with BVH. For peter.dae, without BVH
        we averaged 0.0008 million rays per second, v.s. 1.7335 million rays per
        second with BVH. Since BVH lets us process more rays at a time, it
        allows us to render the entire geometry faster.

      <h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
      <b>Direct Lighting Uniform Hemisphere Sampling </b>

      <p>
        Our function estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere takes in a Ray r, which
        is a ray coming out of the camera, and an Intersection isect, which is
        the intersection of the camera ray with the primitive it hits in the
        scene. The intersect point hit_p = r.o + r.d * isect.t. We want to
        estimate the lighting from this intersection coming directly from a
        light, which we do by sampling num_samples times.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each sample, we draw a random unit direction vector wi (which is in
        object-space) uniformly from a hemisphere by using
        hemisphereSampler->get_sample(). We convert wi to a world-space
        direction world_wi, by applying the object-to-world-space matrix o2w to
        wi. We construct a Ray ray_wi with origin hit_p, direction world_wi, and
        min_t EPS_F (to ‘nudge’ the ray to avoid finding intersection with the
        plane the ray starts on). This secondary, one-bounce ray is shooting out
        hit_p toward the rest of the scene. The point hit_p is only directly
        illuminated if this ray, ray_wi, hits a light.
      </p>

      <p>
        We thus check if bvh->intersect(ray_wi, &temp_isect) returns true. If
        so, we calculate the radiance for this sample L_out_i = (fr * Li *
        cos_theta_i) / pdf, where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>fr = isect.bsdf->f(w_out, -wi)</li>
        <li>Li = tmp_isect.bsdf->get_emission()</li>
        <li>cos_theta_i = dot(wi, Vector3D(0, 0, 1))</li>
        <li>pdf = 1.0 / (2 * PI)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We add L_out_i to L_out, the total radiance from all samples. After all
        samples have been added, we return L_out / number of samples, our
        estimated radiance at hit_p, averaged from all our samples.
      </p>

      <b>Direct Lighting Importance Sampling Lights </b>
      <p>
        The setup is very similar to uniform hemisphere sampling but in
        importance sampling, we use a for loop to iterate through each light in
        the scene and determine num_samples based on whether the light source is
        a point light source. If it is a point light source, we only need to
        sample once since we will always get the same value. Otherwise, we set
        num_samples equal to ns_area_light so that the overall number of samples
        we get by the end is approximately equal to the total number of samples
        for uniform hemisphere sampling.
      </p>

      <p>
        After setting num_samples accordingly, we iteratively call Vector3D Li =
        curr_light->sample_L(hit_p, &wi, &distToLight, &pdf) to get an incoming
        vector wi, the distance between the hit point and the light, as well as
        the pdf used for sampling. We then create a ray going from hit_p in the
        direction of wi (note that wi is in world space coordinate). We set the
        min_t to some small number EPS_F and we set max_t to distToLight - EPS_F
        to bound the ray properly since we care about any intersections within
        the range. We then calculate cos_theta_i and fr similar to what we did
        in uniform hemisphere sampling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, we didn’t bother accounting for lights that are behind the hit
        point so we added the check cos_theta_i > 0 && !bvh->intersect(ray_wi,
        &tmp_isect) before adding (fr * Li * cos_theta_i) / pdf to the total
        amount of radiance per light source. After iterating through num_samples
        per light, we take the average of the radiance per light source and add
        it to the ultimate L_out.

          In the screenshots rendered with 1, 4, 16, and 64 samples per area
          light below (with 1 sample per pixel + light sampling), we observe
          that noise levels in soft shadows decrease as the number of samples
          per light increases. Higher sample counts reduce variance, leading to
          a more accurate representation of shadow transitions. As a result,
          using more samples per light produces smoother and more realistic soft
          shadows.

      <p><b>Uniform Hemisphere Sampling vs Importance Sampling</b></p>
      <p>
        Uniform hemisphere sampling samples rays in all directions even when a
        lot of these rays won’t hit the light source (don’t contribute much to
        the overall illumination, high variance), leading to noisy shadows and
        poorer-looking image quality overall. Importance light sampling, on the
        other hand, focuses on sampling rays going in the direction of the light
        sources directly, generating samples with lower variance and higher
        accuracy and making it much better at capturing how the light affects
        the scene realistically. Therefore, importance sampling results in
        smoother and more realistic soft shadows with fewer samples and the
        overall image also looks much cleaner.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
      <h3>Indirect Lighting Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        In est_radiance_global_illumination(), we made slight modifications to
        make sure we keep track of direct (L_out_direct) and indirect
        (L_out_indirect) lighting separately. If isAccumBounces || r.depth == 0,
        we set L_out_direct to zero_bounce_radiance(). Otherwise, L_out_direct
        is set to Vector3D(0, 0, 0) because we won't need to track the
        illumination until the requested depth. L_out_indirect is set to
        at_least_one_bounce_radiance() regardless and the accumulation logic is
        taken care of in the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        In at_least_one_bounce_radiance(), we first check the ray depth. If the
        ray depth is 0, we stop the recursion and return Vector3D(0, 0, 0), and
        if it's 1, we only return direct lighting using one_bounce_radiance().
        For additional bounces, we add the direct lighting contribution if
        isAccumBounces is enabled, then sample a new bounce direction from the
        BSDF and trace a new ray. In each recursion, we decrement the ray depth
        by 1 until we hit the base case. If this ray intersects another surface,
        we recursively call at_least_one_bounce_radiance(new_r, new_isect) * fr
        * cos_theta_i / pdf / 0.7 to accumulate indirect lighting by adding it
        to L_out. To avoid infinite recursion, we use Russian roulette with a
        70% probability of continuing the path before we make the recursive
        call. We also make sure to divide the radiance by 0.7 when adding it to
        L_out.

        We see that the light source is illuminated in direct illumination, but
        is dark with only indirect illumination, which tracks since indirect
        illumination will not include zero-bounce radiance. The direct
        contribution of the light source on the scene is also excluded in
        indirect illumination, which causes the indirect illumination scene to
        be dimmer overall compared to the direct illumination scene. The shadows
        in the direct illumination scene are much darker and harsher, since they
        cannot be lit by residual light bounces from the environment. Finally,
        in the indirect illumination scene, the spheres, wall, floor, and
        ceiling all have a soft pink/blue color in the parts closer to the pink
        or blue walls, caused by light bouncing off these colored walls. This is
        absent in the direct illumination scene.

      <p>
        When isAccumBounces=false, we see the light source at the top only in
        max_ray_depth=0. In the rest of the screenshots where 1 <= max_ray_depth
        <= 5, we see the image gets dimmer and dimmer. This makes sense because
        the indirect light gets reflected and absorbed at each bounce so the
        amount of light hitting the camera decreases. When isAccumBounces=true,
        direct and indirect lights are accumulated over bounces so the image
        gets progressively brighter. However, as max_ray_depth increases, the
        additional light contribution becomes smaller with each bounce, so it
        becomes hard to tell the difference in the last couple of screenshots.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, the 2nd and 3rd bounces of light make the
        (accumulated) image much brighter and more realistic. The 2nd bounce of
        light allows surfaces that are not directly lit to receive illumination
        from nearby objects. We can see that the underside of the bunny and the
        lower corners of the wall are lit up even though they don't directly
        face the light source. This is because they still receive light that
        bounces off of the floor. The 3rd bounce of light accounts for the more
        subtle interreflections of light across different surfaces in the scene.
        The contribution is minimal as we can see when isAccumBounces=false, the
        3rd bounce of light is much dimmer compared to the 1st and 2nd bounces
        of light. However, it still helps make the overall image more natural.

      <h3>Varying Samples per Pixel</h3>
      <p>
        Below, we compare views of our bunny scene rendered with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
        64, and 1024 samples per pixel (with 4 light ray samples per area
        light). We observe that the noise levels decrease as the
        sample-per-pixel rate increases. Higher sample counts reduce variance,
        leading to a smoother, more realistic, and cleaner rendering. As we
        explained in earlier parts of the writeup, varying -l (samples per light
        area) reduces noise in the soft shadows. In this case, varying -s
        (samples per pixel) decreases the noise levels for the overall image,
        improving the image quality in all aspects.

      <h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
      <p>
        To get rid of noise, one strategy is to increase the number of samples
        per pixel. While this works, it is costly and also does not take into
        account the fact that some pixel's calculated illuminance converges
        faster than others. Adaptive sampling is a strategy to minimize the
        amount of samples we need when we calculate the illuminance of a pixel.
        The idea is to stop sampling early, once we are confident enough that
        the illuminance estimated so far is close to convergence, and only take
        more samples on pixels that are more difficult to converge.
      </p>
      <p>
        We modified our part 1 implementation of raytrace_pixel() to keep track
        of the illuminance, the illuminance squared, the mean, the variance, and
        the convergence level of the samples. As we loop through num_samples, we
        add the current sample's illuminance to the sum of all illuminances and
        the sum of squared illuminances. We also recalculate a new mean,
        variance, and convergence level for every samplesPerBatch number of
        samples. We have a check so that if (i+1) % samplesPerBatch == 0, we
        update the mean, the variance, and the convergence level. If the
        convergence level is less than or equal to maxTolerance * mean at the
        time, we break the loop. After breaking the loop, we then take the
        average of the sample values by dividing it by how many samples we
        actually used before breaking out of the loop and update
        sampleCountBuffer accordingly to generate the rate map.
